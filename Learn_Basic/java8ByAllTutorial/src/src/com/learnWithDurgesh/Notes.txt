Lambda is an anonymous function

1- No name
2- No Modifier
3- No Return type 

Rules for the lambda
1- If the body of the lambda expression contains only statement then curly braces are optional
2- java compiler also inter the type of variable passed in Argument hence writing type is optional.

Functional Interface :
1- if the interface contains only one abstract method then it is functional Interface for example Runnable, Comparable.
2- To call lambda We require Functional Interface in very simple and short manner

Important Benift of using lambda is :
					 Functional Programming: Lambdas enable functional programming in Java, allowing you to pass
					  behavior (functions) as parameters to methods. This is particularly useful with the Streams API.
					  
see whenever we have interface specifically as an functional interface , then in that case there are 3 way to implements
those methods'
 1 - make implement class and then use it in out main method 
 2- make anonymous class and provide implementation their
 3- without writing Implementation we can use lambda to pride the implementation of method written in functional interface
